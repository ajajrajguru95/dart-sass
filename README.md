Dart SASS is the new syntax and version of sass.

Dart Sass is one of the implementations of the Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) preprocessor, which allows you to write more maintainable and structured CSS. Sass extends the CSS syntax with features like variables, mixins, functions, and nested rules, providing powerful capabilities to simplify and enhance your stylesheets.
